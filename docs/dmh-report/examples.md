# Examples of Digital Mental Health Technologies

!!! info "Work in Progress"

    This page is a work-in-progress. Additional examples will be added as they are produced, but the goal is not to develop a comprehensive list nor carry out a systematic review of the examples according to a specific methodology. Rather, it is to provide an illustrative set of examples for those who are new to this field.
    
## Smartphone Apps

There are countless smartphone apps available to consumers. Some are free to download, others require a one-off purchase, and others require ongoing subscriptions. In some instances, employers or other organisations (e.g. Universities) may provide access to individuals through group subscriptions or via formal healthcare services. As a category, `smartphone app` does not provide any indication of the type of functionality of the underlying services. Apps can range from simple meditation apps that could be beneficial for a wide-range of users (e.g. dealing with stress, anxiety, or productivity) to AI chatbots that target users with specific mental health issues. 

A prominent concern in this area is the lack of enforceable regulation that prevents developers from exploiting social media advertising networks to target users with mental health issues (e.g. depression, anxiety) while skirting around medical device regulation by referring to their service as a "well-being tool".

Furthermore, as a recent study by [Mozilla](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/) highlights, the quality of data privacy and protection practices varies widely, with some developers being very transparent about their data collection, analysis, and storage, while others skirt the boundaries of what is legal.

!!! tip "Privacy Not Included"

    The 'Privacy Not Included' study, carried out by Mozilla, is a consumer-facing guide on the apps, services, and internet-connected devices that do and do not respect user rights to data privacy and protection. They have a whole section on mental health apps, which we highly recommend exploring. 
    
    Their methodology is also available here: [https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/about/methodology/](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/about/methodology/)

A recent standard produced by the International Standards Organisation (ISO) demonstrates one means for bringing more structure to health and wellness apps through the standardisation of reporting labels (see Figure 1)[^iso]. Labels such as these could represent a significant type of evidence to ground assurance cases, subject to the formation of consensus around such best practices.

    ---

    According to the [develeoper's website](https://www.wysa.io/faq[), "Wysa AI Coach is an artificial intelligence-based 'emotionally intelligent' service which responds to the emotions you express and uses evidence-based cognitive-behavioral techniques (CBT), DBT, meditation, breathing, yoga, motivational interviewing and micro-actions to help you build mental resilience skills and feel better."
    
    ✅ ML/AI: this app is explicit in its use of AI for enabling automated conversations with users.

    ---

    Headspace’s core products are mobile and web-based apps that focus on mindfulness, meditation, sleep, exercise, and focus content (e.g. guided exercises). The company [publishes research](https://www.headspace.com/science) to support its claims about efficacy and outcomes.
    
    ✅ ML/AI: the use of ML or AI is not a prominent feature in the app, but the organisation does make use of ML to tailor recommendations to users, and has [published plans](https://headspace.medium.com/infrastructure-design-for-real-time-machine-learning-inference-e140793d6741) to make use of additional data.

## Virtual or Augmented Reality (VR/AR)

The use of VR/AR technologies to support mental health are primarily used in research projects at present, while the efficiacy of such tools is investigated. A wide variety of research projects are exploring how these DMHTs could be used to support mental health outcomes related to psychosis, social anxiety, and chronic pain, among others.

    ---

    A research team at the Department of Psychiatry (University of Oxford) have explored how the observation of a virtual body double engaged in social interaction may reduced persecutory thoughts associated with anxiety. The study demonstrates limited but positive evidence for a decreased anxiety.
    
    ✅ ML/AI: automated techniques are used to control the behaviours of the artificial agents that the virtual body double interacts with, although pre-recorded dialogue is also used.

    ---

    Although broader than mental health, chronic pain has stong bi-directional associations with mental health issues, such as depression. Many studies have explored whether VR can help reduce the experience of chronic pain. For instance, allowing users to explore movements in a virtual space that would typically cause an experience of pain were they carried out for real. A recent scoping review of 44 studies concludes that VR can have *short-term* analgesic effects in acute pain settings, but that *long-term* efficacy for chronic pain conditions has not been established.
