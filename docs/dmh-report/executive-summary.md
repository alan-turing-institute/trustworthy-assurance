# Executive Summary

In progress.

## Report Summary

The introduction serves to establish background context for the report, while also outlining the many challenges that exist for research, developers, and regulators working in the domain of digital mental healthcare. The many challenges discussed in this section may appear off-putting to some. However, we have included them in the hope that by being clear and honest about existing knowledge gaps, our report may also contribute to the formation of new research programmes. Towards the end of the introduction, we also provide a further outline of the report and its contributions.
