*[stakeholder]: A person that has an interest (including non-commercial) in a project.

*[neurodiversity]: Neurodiversity refers to the idea that brain function varies from person to person, and is often used in a non-judgement or non-discriminatory context (e.g. neurodiversity should be supported and embraced within teams and organisations).

<!-- *[unsupervised learning]: A type of machine learning that is used to train a model to find patterns in a dataset that is typically unlabelled. It is commonly used for clustering or dimensionality reduction tasks (e.g. clustering data into groups that are not pre-specified by a user).

*[supervised learning]: A type of machine learning that is trained uasing labelled data to predict specific outcomes, including future instances where the outcome may not be known. It is commonly used for classification or regression tasks (e.g. classiying a financial transaction as 'fraudulent' or not 'fraudulent').

*[reinforcement learning]: A type of machine learning that uses an algorithmic procedure to learn an optimal policy (i.e. a set of instructions that tells an agent which actions to take given a particular state). This policy can be used to control the behaviour of software agent (e.g. in games such as Chess or Go), as well as hardware (e.g. actions undertaken by a robotic agent). -->
